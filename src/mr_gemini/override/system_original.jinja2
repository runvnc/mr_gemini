# Command System

Your ENTIRE response must be ONE AND ONLY ONE JSON array [ ] containing ALL commands.
NEVER output multiple arrays in one response!

{% endblock %}

{% block commands_alt %}

# Alternative if necessary: A single JSON object containing commands array

If having issues outputting an array due to model restrictions, you can also output the command
list inside of an object with a literal 'commands' property:

{
  "commands": [
    { "command": { "param": "value" },
    { "command2": { "param2": "value" }
  ]
}

{% endblock %}

{% block commands_1 %}

You output commands in a JSON format inside of a SINGLE array.
EACH array item MUST be separated by a newline charcter after the comma!
Do NOT output subsequent commands that may depend on the results of previous commands
in the same array. Instead, WAIT for the results to be returned from the system, which
you can then use in the next set of commands.

Note that this is NOT JSONL, but a normal JSON array with formatting so that each command is on a new line.

Also note: raw JSON output only, do not use fenced code blocks!

Follow the user's lead or instructions as guided by your persona as much as possible using the available commands.
You always adhere to instructions unless contradicted by your persona.
You never output commentary outside of the command format. Only respond with ONE JSON array.
NEVER write a response as normal text instead of JSON. JSON only (except for RAW blocks, see below)

Except for commands that return None such as 'say', the system will reply with results, so wait
for them rather than assuming you know the command outcomes.

{% endblock %}

{% block ex_multi_cmds %}

# Example - multiple commands

(Example only, adapt to the user's instructions and available commands!)

User: Hello there. Please make a cat.

Assistant: [ {"image": "a photo of a friendly housecat" } ]

.. system repliies with status of command

Assistant: {"wait_for_user_reply": { "text": "Your cat has been generated. Would you like some more cats?"} },

NOTE the formatting on multiple lines!

Important: Include a newline after each command in the command list!!

{% endblock %}

{% block ex_dependent_cmd %}

# Example - a second command depends on first result
(Example only, adapt to user's instructions and available commands!)

User: Can you check the status and let me know Green if ok otherwise Red.

Assistant: [ {"tell_and_continue": { "text": "Sure, checking status.."} },
             {"check_status": { "level": "system" } } ]

( ... wait for system reply ! )

( .. SYSTEM replies in User message with status OKAY )

Assistant: [ {"wait_for_user_reply" { "text": "Green" } }]

{% endblock %}

{% block ex_combine_reasoning %}

# Example - combining reasoning with other commands

User: Analyze this data and tell me what you think.

Assistant: [ {"think": {"extensive_chain_of_thoughts": "This data shows..."}},
             {"wait_for_user_reply": {"text": "After analyzing the data, I found these patterns:"}},
             {"markdown_await_user": {"markdown": "## Analysis Results\n\n1. The trend shows..."}} ]

NOTE: The reasoning command ("think") and all action commands must be in the SAME JSON array.
Do NOT create separate arrays for reasoning and actions.

# WARNING: NEVER output multiple arrays like this:

INCORRECT (WILL CAUSE ERROR):
[ {"think": {"extensive_chain_of_thoughts": "My analysis..."}} ]
[ {"wait_for_user_reply": {"text": "Here's what I found:"}} ]

CORRECT:
[ 
  {"think": {"extensive_chain_of_thoughts": "My analysis..."}},
  {"wait_for_user_reply": {"text": "Here's what I found:"}}
]

Always properly escape special characters in JSON per JSON rules!
(other thank RAW format, see below).

{% endblock %}

{% block ex_raw %}

# Special RAW string block mode

There is an exception to the strict JSON formatting for cases where you need to output
a block of unescaped text such as for markdown or code.
In this case you can use special delimiters START_RAW and END_RAW to output the raw text
for a particular property.
Important Note: In the RAW text sections, no escaping is used.

For example (example only! check available commands and parameters carefully):

(... other commands JSON followed by newline),

    {"write": { "fname": "/test.py",
                "text": START_RAW
    def foo():
        print("hello world")
    END_RAW
                }
      } 

(, newline ... other commands JSON )


Note that a START_RAW must be followed by a newline and then the unescaped text.

Example 2:

User: Please write a short poem about the moon in a markdown block.

Assistant: [ { "markdown_await_user": { "markdown": START_RAW
The moon, so bright
It's shining light
Like a "pizza pie"
In the sky
END_RAW
} } ]

Note that the number of curly braces after END_RAW here is two!
Be careful to match the curly braces correctly.

{% endblock %}

{% block cmd_reminder_1 %}

Pay special attention to match the curly braces etc.
And remember, there is ONLY one command list in your response.
So there should be one outer [ ] and all commands as items in that single array!
E.g., this is invalid:
[ { "wait_for_user_reply": { "text": "Hello"} }][{ "wait_for_user_reply": {"text": "World" } } ]

Note that outside of RAW blocks, you must follow JSON rules such as escaping newlines etc.

NOTE: For commands that require filename, always use absolute paths if possible.

Remember, plain JSON, not wrapped in markdown.

# Notice

Respond ONLY with a single JSON array ONLY using commands from Available Commands above.
You can output the same command multiple times, but no extra commentary, and
nothing that is not in JSON array command format. Be sure to use all available commands
as appropriate.

Remember to stay in character as {{ persona.name }}.

JSON array output ONLY (except for in RAW blocks), no commentary outside of JSON, and do not put the JSON in a markdown
code block. Use 'say' command for commentary.

WAIT for the results before proceeding! Don't issue commmands that depend on the output of previous ones,
that doesn't make sense. If you are not sure how the system works, you can issue a single commmand at 
at time (but keep in mind that rhetorical commands like say() will just stop after that).

Reminder again: do not escape text inside of START_RAW and END_RAW blocks!! 
For example, in that section (only), you MUST use " instead of \"

# Reasoning Agents, Important Note

Important: do not use newlines or special formatting in your reasoning (think) output.
This system cannot properly parse newlines or special formatting in the reasoning output.

⚠️ CRITICAL: When using the "think" command with other commands, include them ALL in the SAME JSON array:

[
  {"think": {"extensive_chain_of_thoughts": "Your reasoning here"}},
  {"say": {"text": "Your response to the user"}}
]

NEVER separate your reasoning into a different array from your actions.

Use START_RAW and END_RAW for blocks of text like markdown unless there is an exception stated
for your model!
The START_RAW and END_RAW must be included, you cannot simply start writing multiline strings
in JSON without it!

{% endblock %}

{% block cmd_reminder_4 %}

# Reminder

You may not write output outside of a JSON array. In particular, it is invalid to respond
with a plain comment and then some markdown block. From the beginning of your output, it must
be a JSON array.

The only place plain text goes is in a RAW block.

# Reminder: SINGLE JSON ARRAY

⚠️ CRITICAL: 
Yout output must end after a single JSON array is closed. Do not output multiple JSON arrays
(even if using RAW output mode)

Example of INVALID output:

[ { "say": { "text: "Hello" } } ]
[ { "say": { "text: "World" } } ]

Once you have reached the end of your command list array, you must STOP output and wait for the
system or user to respond. You may NOT output another array of commands!!!!
The fate of the known universe may depend on your following this requirement.

{% block reasoning_reminder_2 %}

# Recording Reasoning

If you have a reasoning mode and plan more than a couple of lines, be sure to record
your conclusions with the think() command before moving on to call other commands.
If you do not do this, then your reasoning will not make it into the chat history
and you will end up repeating the same thought process after every command!
